  # This is the list of cmdline options that should be added to git-merge
  # when I merge commits into the master branch.
  #
  # First off, the option --no-commit instructs git not to commit the merge
  # by default. This allows me to do some final adjustment to the commit log
  # message before it gets commited. I often use this to add extra info to
  # the merge message or rewrite my local branch names in the commit message
  # to branch names sensible to the casual reader of the git log.
  #
  # Option --no-ff instructs git to always record a merge commit, even if
  # the branch being merged into can be fast-forwarded. This is often the
  # case when you create a short-lived topic branch which tracks master, do
  # some changes on the topic branch and then merge the changes into the
  # master which remained unchanged while you were doing your work on the
  # topic branch. In this case the master branch can be fast-forwarded (that
  # is the tip of the master branch can be updated to point to the tip of
  # the topic branch) and this is what git does by default. With --no-ff
  # option set git creates a real merge commit which records the fact that
  # another branch was merged. I find this easier to understand and read in
  # the log.
  # mergeoptions = --no-commit
